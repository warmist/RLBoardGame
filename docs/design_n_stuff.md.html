# Design doc

A random assortment of game ideas and mechanics thrown together.

# Mechanics

## Wound system

Instead of health have wound cards that get added to the deck or
hand or discard. Some interesting features:
* Worst damage gets added to hand, a bit less bad to deck and least
  problematic to discard
* The cards could have effects themselves
    - Auto destroy - some minor wound
    - Do something bad (e.g. add more wounds) - bleeding?
    - Need AP to remove
    - Do not discard at the end
* Lose if you have e.g. 3 wounds in your hand
* Healings could remove wounds from hand, then draw, then discard

## Items

Initial idea was to have all cards added because item gives them (e.g. sword
add 3 strike cards, 1 parry, ...) that has nice features and makes it easy to
have the deck building by manging items. Games that already do that: [guild of dungeneering][GoD] and [card hunter][ch]. Other random ideas:
* Item damage that makes it loose cards
* Item crafting/modification so you further customize your deck

## Skills

This is a twist (or modification) on the items idea. You could get cards from
items but they only provide POTENTIAL. You need skill to get those cards. This would work like this: Sword (3 fighting, 1 finesse) gives you only 1 card until you raise your skills. Some unanswered questions:
* How do you raise skills?
* How to learn new skills?

Another idea: using item lets you add X cards to your deck. Using can be: killing enemies or times used or times discarded or times destroyed etc...

# Misc

* Persistence: do not generate new world each time. Let reexplore the same one.
    - Raise-dead/resurrect old chars/collect their loot
    - Somehow remix the world a bit? Collapse some walls, maybe dig some more?
    - Maybe portal idea links to this
* The map is constantly growing by adding stuff from center outwards. Center is fixed but everything else get slowly (each death/run) further from center.
    - Makes retrieving things harder
    - Makes map more interesting as explored areas mix with new ones
* Cards that can be played from the deck/discard: Good idea or not?
* Class/race gives the passives that change how it's played (i.e. [slay the spire artifacts][sts])
* Item/creature world? 
    - Tweak decks by entering item worlds.
    - Resurrect creatures by battling their death inside them
* Room cards? Room shards? some way to add/expand the map
* Magic vs Swords vs Ranger vs ??. Can be differentiated by:
    - more single card vs more multi card/combos
    - more item gives cards vs using item unlocks cards
    - card mechanics: cards that are just "use-discard-draw" vs "use to add cards to deck-destroy" vs "on discard do X" vs "only when X happens do sth" vs etc...
    - wounds: magic might be harder with wounds, fighting easier?


## Todo

* Sounds
* Card movement animations
* Lua-ify everything
* Card layout problems
    - Not enough text fits
    - Some ascii art?
    - Links to mechanics
* Gui problems
    - Ugly bad actions position
* Card ideas and possible mechanics
* Deck building ideas and rethink
